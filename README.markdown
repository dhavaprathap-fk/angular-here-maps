## Getting started
This is a set of directives and services for AngularJS `~1.0.7+, ^1.2.2+`.

If you plan to hack on the directives or want to run the example, first thing to do is to install NPM dependencies:

```shell
npm install #note bower install is run on post install 
```

### Building
To build the library after you made changes, simply run grunt:

```shell
grunt
```

### Running the example
To run the example page, just run

```shell
grunt serve
```

and your browser will automatically open on `http://localhost:9000`.
